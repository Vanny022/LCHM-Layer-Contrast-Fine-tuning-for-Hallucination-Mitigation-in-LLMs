2283,What is the probability of getting 35 heads in a coin toss of 50 coins?,"To calculate the probability of getting 35 heads in a coin toss of 50 coins, we need to use the binomial distribution formula, which is:

P(X=k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

where:
- P(X=k) is the probability of getting k successes
- n is the number of trials
- p is the probability of success on a single trial
- (n choose k) is the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose k successes out of n trials

In this case, we want to find P(X=35), where:
- k = 35
- n = 50
- p = 0.5 (since the coin is fair)

Using the formula, we get:

P(X=35) = (50 choose 35) * 0.5^35 * (1-0.5)^(50-35)
         ≈ 0.0391

Therefore, the probability of getting exactly 35 heads in a coin toss of 50 coins is approximately 0.0391 or 3.91%.",no,[],yes

4314,"Given an equation, solve it and explain the steps
3x + 4 = 2x + 12","Step 1: Move the variables to one side of the equation.

To do this, we need to subtract 2x from both sides of the equation:

3x + 4 - 2x = 2x + 12 - 2x

Simplifying the left side:

x + 4 = 12

Step 2: Isolate the variable.

To do this, we need to subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x + 4 - 4 = 12 - 4

Simplifying:

x = 8

Therefore, the solution is x = 8. We can check this by plugging x = 8 back into the original equation:

3x + 4 = 2x + 12

3(8) + 4 = 2(8) + 12

M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n – 1]

Hang a kite in the shape of a bird from a nearby tree or pole close to your garden. As the kite sways in the wind, it will give an impression to other birds that there is a predator in the area, causing them to avoid your garden. Additionally, using a reflective tape or a shiny bird decoy will also keep birds away from your garden. By using these innovative tactics, you can efficiently protect your garden from pesky birds.",no,[],yes

The sweet smell of roses","The sweet smell of roses blooming,
A fragrance that fills the air,
It speaks of love and romance,
Of moments beyond compare.

The petals soft and delicate,
In hues of pink and red,
A sight to behold and cherish,
With secrets hidden deep within.

The leaves sway gently in the breeze,
A dance as old as time,
And though they may wither and fade,
Their beauty remains divine.

And bask in this lovely scene,
For in the sweet smell of roses,
We find a love that's evergreen.",no,[],yes
